   abstract = {The solvation energy and entropy at infinite dilution consist of a solute-solvent term and a solvent reorganization term representing the contributions of changes in solvent structure upon solute insertion. In the standard, homogeneous treatment of solutions, changes in solvent structure are expressed through derivatives of the homogeneous pair correlation function, which are very difficult to obtain by simulation. Tractable expressions for the solvation energy and entropy are here derived by viewing the solution as an inhomogeneous system with the solute fixed at a certain point. The solvent reorganization terms in the inhomogeneous view contain two contributions: the local, "correlation" contributions, which are due to correlations between the solute and the solvent and dominate at high densities, and the nonlocal, "liberation" contributions, which are due to the effective dilution of the solvent caused by the thermal motion of the solute and dominate at low densities. The liberation contributions are independent of the nature or size of the solute and depend only on the properties of the solvent. For common liquid solvents the nonlocal terms are negligible and the solvation properties arise almost entirely from effects localized around the solute. The new expressions are tested by calculations of the solvent reorganization energy and entropy in ideal hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones mixtures (solute identical to solvent). The solvent reorganization energy and entropy make distinct and significant contributions to the solvation free energy. The theory can be applied to truly inhomogeneous systems as well as small solute solvation, thus:providing a connection between interfacial phenomena and microscopic solvation.},

   abstract = {The displacement of perturbed water upon binding is believed to play a critical role in the thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition, but it is nontrivial to unambiguously define and answer questions about this process. We address this issue by introducing grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST), which discretizes the equations of inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) onto a three-dimensional grid situated in the region of interest around a solute molecule or complex. Snapshots from explicit solvent simulations are used to estimate localized solvation entropies, energies, and free energies associated with the grid boxes, or voxels, and properly summing these thermodynamic quantities over voxels yields information about hydration thermodynamics. GIST thus provides a smoothly varying representation of water properties as a function of position, rather than focusing on hydration sites where solvent is present at high density. It therefore accounts for full or partial displacement of water from sites that are highly occupied by water, as well as for partly occupied and water-depleted regions around the solute. GIST can also provide a well-defined estimate of the solvation free energy and therefore enables a rigorous end-states analysis of binding. For example, one may not only use a first GIST calculation to project the thermodynamic consequences of displacing water from the surface of a receptor by a ligand, but also account, in a second GIST calculation, for the thermodynamics of subsequent solvent reorganization around the bound complex. In the present study, a first GIST analysis of the molecular host cucurbit[7]uril is found to yield a rich picture of hydration structure and thermodynamics in and around this miniature receptor. One of the most striking results is the observation of a toroidal region of high water density at the center of the host's nonpolar cavity. Despite its high density, the water in this toroidal region is disfavored energetically and entropically, and hence may contribute to the known ability of this small receptor to bind guest molecules with unusually high affinities. Interestingly, the toroidal region of high water density persists even when all partial charges of the receptor are set to zero. Thus, localized regions of high solvent density can be generated in a binding site without strong, attractive solute-solvent interactions. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   abstract = {The expulsion of water from surfaces upon molecular recognition and nonspecific association makes a major contribution to the free energy changes of these processes. In order to facilitate the characterization of water structure and thermodynamics on surfaces, we have incorporated Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) into the CPPTRAJ toolset of AmberTools. GIST is a grid-based implementation of Inhomogeneous Fluid Solvation Theory, which analyzes the output from molecular dynamics simulations to map out solvation thermodynamic and structural properties on a high-resolution, three-dimensional grid. The CPPTRAJ implementation, called GIST-cpptraj, has a simple, easy-to-use command line interface, and is open source and freely distributed. We have also developed a set of open-source tools, called GISTPP, which facilitate the analysis of GIST output grids. Tutorials for both GIST-cpptraj and GISTPP can be found at ambermd.org.

   abstract = {Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) maps out solvation thermodynamic properties on a fine meshed grid and provides a statistical mechanical formalism for thermodynamic end-state calculations. However, differences in how long-range nonbonded interactions are calculated in molecular dynamics engines and in the current implementation of GIST have prevented precise comparisons between free energies estimated using GIST and those from other free energy methods such as thermodynamic integration (TI). Here, we address this by presenting PME-GIST, a formalism by which particle mesh Ewald (PME)-based electrostatic energies and long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) energies are decomposed and assigned to individual atoms and the corresponding voxels they occupy in a manner consistent with the GIST approach. PME-GIST yields potential energy calculations that are precisely consistent with modern simulation engines and performs these calculations at a dramatically faster speed than prior implementations. Here, we apply PME-GIST end-state analyses to 32 small molecules whose solvation free energies are close to evenly distributed from 2 kcal/mol to -17 kcal/mol and obtain solvation energies consistent with TI calculations (R(2) = 0.99, mean unsigned difference 0.8 kcal/mol). We also estimate the entropy contribution from the second and higher order entropy terms that are truncated in GIST by the differences between entropies calculated in TI and GIST. With a simple correction for the high order entropy terms, PME-GIST obtains solvation free energies that are highly consistent with TI calculations (R(2) = 0.99, mean unsigned difference = 0.4 kcal/mol) and experimental results (R(2) = 0.88, mean unsigned difference = 1.4 kcal/mol). The precision of PME-GIST also enables us to show that the solvation free energy of small hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules can be largely understood based on perturbations of the solvent in a region extending a few solvation shells from the solute. We have integrated PME-GIST into the open-source molecular dynamics analysis software CPPTRAJ.},

   abstract = {Reliable information on partition coefficients plays a key role in drug development, as solubility decisively affects bioavailability. In a physicochemical context, the partition coefficient of a solute between two different solvents can be described as a function of solvation free energies. Hence, substantial scientific efforts have been made toward accurate predictions of solvation free energies in various solvents. The grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST) facilitates the calculation of solvation free energies. In this study, we introduce an extended version of the GIST algorithm, which enables the calculation for chloroform in addition to water. Furthermore, GIST allows localization of enthalpic and entropic contributions. We test our approach by calculating partition coefficients between water and chloroform for a set of eight small molecules. We report a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 between experimentally determined and calculated partition coefficients. The capability to reliably predict partition coefficients between water and chloroform and the possibility to localize their contributions allow the optimization of a compound's partition coefficient. Therefore, we presume that this methodology will be of great benefit for the efficient development of pharmaceuticals.},

The double mutant exhibits a binding affinity similar to 2 x 107 times lower than that of wild-type streptavidin at 25 degrees C. The corresponding reduction in binding free energy (Delta Delta G) of 10.1 kcal/mol was nearly completely due to binding enthalpy losses at this temperature. The loss of binding affinity is 11-fold greater than that predicted by a linear combination of the single-mutant energetic perturbations (8.7 kcal/mol), indicating that these two mutations interact cooperatively. Crystallographic characterization of the double mutant and comparison with the two single mutant structures suggest that structural rearrangements at the S45 position, when the D128 carboxylate is removed, mask the true energetic contribution of the D128-biotin interaction. Taken together, the thermodynamic and structural analyses support the conclusion that the wild-type hydrogen bond between D128-OD and biotin-N2 is thermodynamically stronger than that between S45-OG and biotin N1.},

   abstract = {An entropically-driven binding interaction at a certain temperature may change to an enthalpically-driven process at another temperature, depending on the polarization state of the groups that are involved in binding. The streptavidin-biotin complex has been extensively studied across biological, medical, chemical and material science fields using various techniques, however, not much has been reported on this interaction across a broad temperature range, between 2 degrees C and 40 degrees C using biophysical techniques. In this study, we determined how the forces involved in the streptavidin-biotin complex formation are affected by the reaction temperature using the Affinity ITC (TA Instruments). We observed that this complex formation is a spontaneous binding process, indicated by a negative Gibbs energy (Delta G) at all temperatures tested. The observed negative heat capacity (Delta C-p) similar to -459.9 cal/mol K highlights the polar solvation of the interaction that corresponds to a decreasing enthalpy (more negative) (Delta H) with increasing reaction temperature. The stoichiometry (n) of 0.98 was estimated at 25 degrees C. An increase in reaction temperature resulted in an almost two-fold increase or more in n, notably from 1.59 to 3.41 between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Whereas, at lower reaction temperatures, 2 degrees C to 10 degrees C, higher molar binding ratios were recorded, i.e. 2.74 to 5.76. We report an enthalpically-driven interaction between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C whereas, an entropically-favourable interaction is observed at lower temperatures, suggestive of an interaction dominated by nonpolar interactions at lower temperatures and polar interactions at higher temperatures. Consequently, alterations in the polarisation state of streptavidin result in moderate binding affinity of biotin to streptavidin at higher reaction temperatures, K-D 10(-4) <= 10(-5) M.},
