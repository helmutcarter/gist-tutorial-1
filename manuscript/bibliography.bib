   abstract = {The solvation energy and entropy at infinite dilution consist of a solute-solvent term and a solvent reorganization term representing the contributions of changes in solvent structure upon solute insertion. In the standard, homogeneous treatment of solutions, changes in solvent structure are expressed through derivatives of the homogeneous pair correlation function, which are very difficult to obtain by simulation. Tractable expressions for the solvation energy and entropy are here derived by viewing the solution as an inhomogeneous system with the solute fixed at a certain point. The solvent reorganization terms in the inhomogeneous view contain two contributions: the local, "correlation" contributions, which are due to correlations between the solute and the solvent and dominate at high densities, and the nonlocal, "liberation" contributions, which are due to the effective dilution of the solvent caused by the thermal motion of the solute and dominate at low densities. The liberation contributions are independent of the nature or size of the solute and depend only on the properties of the solvent. For common liquid solvents the nonlocal terms are negligible and the solvation properties arise almost entirely from effects localized around the solute. The new expressions are tested by calculations of the solvent reorganization energy and entropy in ideal hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones mixtures (solute identical to solvent). The solvent reorganization energy and entropy make distinct and significant contributions to the solvation free energy. The theory can be applied to truly inhomogeneous systems as well as small solute solvation, thus:providing a connection between interfacial phenomena and microscopic solvation.},

   abstract = {The displacement of perturbed water upon binding is believed to play a critical role in the thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition, but it is nontrivial to unambiguously define and answer questions about this process. We address this issue by introducing grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST), which discretizes the equations of inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) onto a three-dimensional grid situated in the region of interest around a solute molecule or complex. Snapshots from explicit solvent simulations are used to estimate localized solvation entropies, energies, and free energies associated with the grid boxes, or voxels, and properly summing these thermodynamic quantities over voxels yields information about hydration thermodynamics. GIST thus provides a smoothly varying representation of water properties as a function of position, rather than focusing on hydration sites where solvent is present at high density. It therefore accounts for full or partial displacement of water from sites that are highly occupied by water, as well as for partly occupied and water-depleted regions around the solute. GIST can also provide a well-defined estimate of the solvation free energy and therefore enables a rigorous end-states analysis of binding. For example, one may not only use a first GIST calculation to project the thermodynamic consequences of displacing water from the surface of a receptor by a ligand, but also account, in a second GIST calculation, for the thermodynamics of subsequent solvent reorganization around the bound complex. In the present study, a first GIST analysis of the molecular host cucurbit[7]uril is found to yield a rich picture of hydration structure and thermodynamics in and around this miniature receptor. One of the most striking results is the observation of a toroidal region of high water density at the center of the host's nonpolar cavity. Despite its high density, the water in this toroidal region is disfavored energetically and entropically, and hence may contribute to the known ability of this small receptor to bind guest molecules with unusually high affinities. Interestingly, the toroidal region of high water density persists even when all partial charges of the receptor are set to zero. Thus, localized regions of high solvent density can be generated in a binding site without strong, attractive solute-solvent interactions. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

GIST is a grid-based implementation of Inhomogeneous Fluid Solvation Theory, which analyzes the output from molecular dynamics simulations to map out solvation thermodynamic and structural properties on a high-resolution, three-dimensional grid. The CPPTRAJ implementation, called GIST-cpptraj, has a simple, easy-to-use command line interface, and is open source and freely distributed. We have also developed a set of open-source tools, called GISTPP, which facilitate the analysis of GIST output grids. Tutorials for both GIST-cpptraj and GISTPP can be found at ambermd.org.

   abstract = {Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) maps out solvation thermodynamic properties on a fine meshed grid and provides a statistical mechanical formalism for thermodynamic end-state calculations. However, differences in how long-range nonbonded interactions are calculated in molecular dynamics engines and in the current implementation of GIST have prevented precise comparisons between free energies estimated using GIST and those from other free energy methods such as thermodynamic integration (TI). Here, we address this by presenting PME-GIST, a formalism by which particle mesh Ewald (PME)-based electrostatic energies and long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) energies are decomposed and assigned to individual atoms and the corresponding voxels they occupy in a manner consistent with the GIST approach. PME-GIST yields potential energy calculations that are precisely consistent with modern simulation engines and performs these calculations at a dramatically faster speed than prior implementations. Here, we apply PME-GIST end-state analyses to 32 small molecules whose solvation free energies are close to evenly distributed from 2 kcal/mol to -17 kcal/mol and obtain solvation energies consistent with TI calculations (R(2) = 0.99, mean unsigned difference 0.8 kcal/mol). We also estimate the entropy contribution from the second and higher order entropy terms that are truncated in GIST by the differences between entropies calculated in TI and GIST. With a simple correction for the high order entropy terms, PME-GIST obtains solvation free energies that are highly consistent with TI calculations (R(2) = 0.99, mean unsigned difference = 0.4 kcal/mol) and experimental results (R(2) = 0.88, mean unsigned difference = 1.4 kcal/mol). The precision of PME-GIST also enables us to show that the solvation free energy of small hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules can be largely understood based on perturbations of the solvent in a region extending a few solvation shells from the solute. We have integrated PME-GIST into the open-source molecular dynamics analysis software CPPTRAJ.},

   abstract = {The relation of surface polarity and conformational preferences is decisive for cell permeability and thus bioavailability of macrocyclic drugs. Here, we employ grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST) to calculate solvation free energies for a series of six macrocycles in water and chloroform as a measure of passive membrane permeability. We perform accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to capture a diverse structural ensemble in water and chloroform, allowing for a direct profiling of solvent-dependent conformational preferences. Subsequent GIST calculations facilitate a quantitative measure of solvent preference in the form of a transfer free energy, calculated from the ensemblea-veraged solvation free energies in water and chloroform. Hence, the proposed method considers how the conformational diversity of macrocycles in polar and apolar solvents translates into transfer free energies. Following this strategy, we find a striking correlation of 0.92 between experimentally determined cell permeabilities and calculated transfer free energies. For the studied model systems, we find that the transfer free energy exceeds the purely water- based solvation free energies as a reliable estimate of cell permeability and that conformational sampling is imperative for a physically meaningful model. We thus recommend this purely physics-based approach as a computational tool to assess cell permeabilities of macrocyclic drug candidates.},

   abstract = {Reliable information on partition coefficients plays a key role in drug development, as solubility decisively affects bioavailability. In a physicochemical context, the partition coefficient of a solute between two different solvents can be described as a function of solvation free energies. Hence, substantial scientific efforts have been made toward accurate predictions of solvation free energies in various solvents. The grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST) facilitates the calculation of solvation free energies. In this study, we introduce an extended version of the GIST algorithm, which enables the calculation for chloroform in addition to water. Furthermore, GIST allows localization of enthalpic and entropic contributions. We test our approach by calculating partition coefficients between water and chloroform for a set of eight small molecules. We report a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 between experimentally determined and calculated partition coefficients. The capability to reliably predict partition coefficients between water and chloroform and the possibility to localize their contributions allow the optimization of a compound's partition coefficient. Therefore, we presume that this methodology will be of great benefit for the efficient development of pharmaceuticals.},

The double mutant exhibits a binding affinity similar to 2 x 107 times lower than that of wild-type streptavidin at 25 degrees C. The corresponding reduction in binding free energy (Delta Delta G) of 10.1 kcal/mol was nearly completely due to binding enthalpy losses at this temperature. The loss of binding affinity is 11-fold greater than that predicted by a linear combination of the single-mutant energetic perturbations (8.7 kcal/mol), indicating that these two mutations interact cooperatively. Crystallographic characterization of the double mutant and comparison with the two single mutant structures suggest that structural rearrangements at the S45 position, when the D128 carboxylate is removed, mask the true energetic contribution of the D128-biotin interaction. Taken together, the thermodynamic and structural analyses support the conclusion that the wild-type hydrogen bond between D128-OD and biotin-N2 is thermodynamically stronger than that between S45-OG and biotin N1.},

   abstract = {An entropically-driven binding interaction at a certain temperature may change to an enthalpically-driven process at another temperature, depending on the polarization state of the groups that are involved in binding. The streptavidin-biotin complex has been extensively studied across biological, medical, chemical and material science fields using various techniques, however, not much has been reported on this interaction across a broad temperature range, between 2 degrees C and 40 degrees C using biophysical techniques. In this study, we determined how the forces involved in the streptavidin-biotin complex formation are affected by the reaction temperature using the Affinity ITC (TA Instruments). We observed that this complex formation is a spontaneous binding process, indicated by a negative Gibbs energy (Delta G) at all temperatures tested. The observed negative heat capacity (Delta C-p) similar to -459.9 cal/mol K highlights the polar solvation of the interaction that corresponds to a decreasing enthalpy (more negative) (Delta H) with increasing reaction temperature. The stoichiometry (n) of 0.98 was estimated at 25 degrees C. An increase in reaction temperature resulted in an almost two-fold increase or more in n, notably from 1.59 to 3.41 between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Whereas, at lower reaction temperatures, 2 degrees C to 10 degrees C, higher molar binding ratios were recorded, i.e. 2.74 to 5.76. We report an enthalpically-driven interaction between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C whereas, an entropically-favourable interaction is observed at lower temperatures, suggestive of an interaction dominated by nonpolar interactions at lower temperatures and polar interactions at higher temperatures. Consequently, alterations in the polarisation state of streptavidin result in moderate binding affinity of biotin to streptavidin at higher reaction temperatures, K-D 10(-4) <= 10(-5) M.},

  abstract  = "Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) has proven useful to
               calculate localized thermodynamic properties of water around a
               solute. Numerous studies have leveraged this information to
               enhance structure-based binding predictions. We have recently
               extended GIST toward chloroform as a solvent to allow the
               prediction of passive membrane permeability. Here, we further
               generalize the GIST algorithm toward all solvents that can be
               modeled as rigid molecules. This restriction is inherent to the
               method and is already present in the inhomogeneous solvation
               theory. Here, we show that our approach can be applied to
               various solvent molecules by comparing the results of GIST
               simulations with thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations and
               experimental results. Additionally, we analyze and compare a
               matrix consisting of 100 entries of ten different solvent
               molecules solvated within each other. We find that the GIST
               results are highly correlated with TI calculations as well as
               experiments. For some solvents, we find Pearson correlations of
               up to 0.99 to the true entropy, while others are affected by the
               first-order approximation more strongly. The enthalpy-entropy
               splitting provided by GIST allows us to extend a recently
               published approach, which estimates higher order entropies by a
               linear scaling of the first-order entropy, to solvents other
               than water. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence of GIST
               in different solvents. We conclude that our extension to GIST
               reliably calculates localized thermodynamic properties for
               different solvents and thereby significantly extends the
               applicability of this widely used method.",

               of binding free energy. Although continuum theories of hydration

   abstract = {Hydration thermodynamics play a fundamental role in fields ranging from the pharmaceutical industry to environmental research. Numerous methods exist to predict solvation thermodynamics of compounds ranging from small molecules to large biomolecules. Arguably the most precise methods are those based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent. One theory that has seen increased use is inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST). However, while many applications require accurate description of salt-water mixtures, no implementation of IST is currently able to estimate solvation properties involving more than one solvent species. Here, we present an extension to grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST) that can take salt contributions into account. At the example of carbazole in 1 M NaCl solution, we compute the solvation energy as well as first and second order entropies. While the effect of the first order ion entropy is small, both the water-water and water-ion entropies contribute strongly. We show that the water-ion entropies are efficiently approximated using the Kirkwood superposition approximation. However, this approach cannot be applied to the water-water entropy. Furthermore, we test the quantitative validity of our method by computing salting-out coefficients and comparing them to experimental data. We find a good correlation to experimental salting-out constants, while the absolute values are overpredicted due to the approximate second order entropy. Since ions are frequently used in MD, either to neutralize the system or as a part of the investigated process, our method greatly extends the applicability of GIST. The use-cases range from biopharmaceuticals, where many assays require high salt concentrations, to environmental research, where solubility in sea water is important to model the fate of organic substances.},

               spatial mappings of both energy and entropy around a solute of

               entirely limited to the first-order terms in the IST's entropy

               solvation (MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA) methods are popular approaches
               to estimate the free energy of the binding of small ligands to
               biological macromolecules. They are typically based on molecular
               dynamics simulations of the receptor-ligand complex and are
               therefore intermediate in both accuracy and computational effort
               between empirical scoring and strict alchemical perturbation
               methods. They have been applied to a large number of systems
               with varying success. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the use
               of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods to calculate ligand-binding
               affinities, with an emphasis on calibration, testing and
               validation, as well as attempts to improve the methods, rather
               than on specific applications. EXPERT OPINION: MM/PBSA and
               MM/GBSA are attractive approaches owing to their modular nature
               and that they do not require calculations on a training set.
               They have been used successfully to reproduce and rationalize
               experimental findings and to improve the results of virtual
               screening and docking. However, they contain several crude and
               questionable approximations, for example, the lack of
               conformational entropy and information about the number and free
               energy of water molecules in the binding site. Moreover, there
               are many variants of the method and their performance varies
               strongly with the tested system. Likewise, most attempts to
               ameliorate the methods with more accurate approaches, for
               example, quantum-mechanical calculations, polarizable force
               fields or improved solvation have deteriorated the results.",

               understanding many physicochemical phenomena, including
               lipophilicity, phase equilibria and liquid-phase reaction
               equilibrium and kinetics, there is a need for predictive models
               that can be applied across large sets of solvents and solutes.
               In this paper, we propose two quantitative structure property
               relationships (QSPRs) to predict the Gibbs free energy of
               solvation, developed using partial least squares (PLS) and
               multivariate linear regression (MLR) methods for 295 solutes in
               210 solvents with total number of data points of 1777. Unlike
               other QSPR models, the proposed models are not restricted to a
               specific solvent or solute. Furthermore, while most QSPR models
               include either experimental or quantum mechanical descriptors,
               the proposed models combine both, using experimental descriptors
               to represent the solvent and quantum mechanical descriptors to
               represent the solute. Up to twelve experimental descriptors and
               nine quantum mechanical descriptors are considered in the
               proposed models. Extensive internal and external validation is
               undertaken to assess model accuracy in predicting the Gibbs free
               energy of solvation for a large number of solute/solvent pairs.
               The best MLR model, which includes three solute descriptors and
               two solvent properties, yields a coefficient of determination
               (R2) of 0.88 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.59 kcal
               mol-1 for the training set. The best PLS model includes six
               latent variables, and has an R2 value of 0.91 and a RMSE of 0.52
               kcal mol-1. The proposed models are compared to selected results
               based on continuum solvation quantum chemistry calculations.
               They enable the fast prediction of the Gibbs free energy of
               solvation of a wide range of solutes in different solvents.",

To address this shortcoming, we present a method for performing constant pH molecular dynamics simulations (CpHMD) in explicit solvent using a discrete protonation state model. The method involves standard molecular dynamics (MD) being propagated in explicit solvent followed by protonation state changes being attempted in GB implicit solvent at fixed intervals. Replica exchange along the pH-dimension (pH-REMD) helps to obtain acceptable titration behavior with the proposed method. We analyzed the effects of various parameters and settings on the CpH_MD and pH-REMD in explicit solvent, including the size of the simulation unit cell and the length of the relaxation dynamics following protonation state changes. We tested the method with the amino acid model compounds, a small pentapeptide with two titratable sites, and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). The proposed method yields superior predicted pK(a) values for HEWL over hundreds of nanoseconds of simulation relative to corresponding predicted values from simulations run in implicit solvent.},

Here, we study how the change of solvent affects the solubility of a given compound. That is, we calculate relative solubilities. We use MD simulations to calculate relative solubility and compare our calculated values with experiment as well as with results from several other methods, SMD and UNIFAC, the latter of which is commonly used in chemical engineering design. We find that straightforward solubility calculations based on molecular simulations using a general small-molecule force field outperform SMD and UNIFAC both in terms of accuracy and coverage of the relevant chemical space.},

First, the inverse temperature phenomenology of hydrophobic interactions, i.e., strengthening of hydrophobic bonds with increasing temperature, is decisively exhibited by hydrophobic interactions between atomic-scale hard sphere solutes in water. Second, inclusion of attractive interactions associated with atomic-size hydrophobic reference cases leads to substantial, nontrivial corrections to reference results for purely repulsive solutes. Hydrophobic bonds are weakened by adding solute dispersion forces to treatment of reference cases. The classic statistical mechanical theory for those corrections is not accurate in this application, but molecular quasi-chemical theory shows promise. Finally, because of the masking roles of excluded volume and attractive interactions, comparisons that do not discriminate the different possibilities face an interpretive danger.},

               wrapper script around the ANTECHAMBER software that simplifies
               the generation of small molecule topologies and parameters for a
               variety of molecular dynamics programmes like GROMACS, CHARMM
               and CNS. It is written in the Python programming language and
               was developed as a tool for interfacing with other Python based
               applications such as the CCPN software suite (for NMR data
               analysis) and ARIA (for structure calculations from NMR data).
               ACPYPE is open source code, under GNU GPL v3, and is available

               as a web portal application at http://webapps.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype.
               FINDINGS: We verified the topologies generated by ACPYPE in
               three ways: by comparing with default AMBER topologies for
               standard amino acids; by generating and verifying topologies for
               a large set of ligands from the PDB; and by recalculating the
               structures for 5 protein-ligand complexes from the PDB.
               CONCLUSIONS: ACPYPE is a tool that simplifies the automatic
               generation of topology and parameters in different formats for
               different molecular mechanics programmes, including calculation

  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: Molecular simulation has historically been a
               low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing
               amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by
               enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many
               conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of
               ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling
               now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction
               and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These
               applications share a need for fast and efficient software that
               can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers,
               distributed computing or cloud resources. RESULTS: Here, we
               present a range of new simulation algorithms and features
               developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5
               software package. The software now automatically handles wide
               classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and
               lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these
               molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent
               models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software
               now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on
               low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together
               with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art
               parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and
               cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively
               parallel simulations. AVAILABILITY: GROMACS is an open source
               and free software available from http://www.gromacs.org.

               streptavidin) are widely used in molecular science owing to
               their highly selective and stable interaction with biotin. Other
               factors also contribute to the popularity of the
               streptavidin-biotin system, including the stability of the
               protein and various chemical and enzymatic biotinylation methods
               available for use with different experimental designs. The
               technology has enjoyed a renaissance of a sort in recent years,
               as new streptavidin variants are engineered to complement native
               proteins and novel methods of introducing selective
               biotinylation are developed for in vitro and in vivo
               applications. There have been notable developments in the areas
               of catalysis, cell biology, and proteomics in addition to
               continued applications in the more established areas of
               detection, labeling and drug delivery. This review summarizes

@ARTICLE{McConnell2021-biotin,
  title     = "Biotin's lessons in drug design",
  author    = "McConnell, Darryl B",
  abstract  = "At the heart of drug design is the discovery of molecules that
               bind with high affinity to their drug targets. Biotin forms the
               strongest known noncovalent ligand-protein interactions with
               avidin and streptavidin, achieving femtomolar and picomolar
               affinities, respectively. This is made even more exceptional
               because biotin achieves this with a meagre molecular weight of
               240 Da. Surprisingly, the approaches by which biotin achieves
               this are not in the standard repertoire of current medicinal
               chemistry practice. Biotin's biggest lesson is the importance of
               nonclassical H-bonds in protein-ligand complexes. Most of
               biotin's affinity stems from its flexible valeric acid side
               chain that forms CH-$\pi$, CH-O, and classical H-bonds with the
               lipophilic region of the binding pocket. Biotin also utilizes an
               oxyanion hole, a sulfur-centered H-bond, and water solvation in
               the bound state to achieve its potency. The facets and
               advantages of biotin's approach to binding should be more widely
               adopted in drug design.",
